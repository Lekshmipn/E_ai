2008,2,"Cmv: people we consider ""evil"" do not believe that their actions are evil:","Currently, I am just curious and possibly wondering about the perceptions of evil or bad people. When I think of people that the USA (Yes, I am American) consider bad, my mind trends toward Putin, Osama bin Laden, and other people that oppose capitalism and western ideas. In the media and in schools, we are taught that these people are evil, but I don't think that the people that we consider evil wake up every morning and say,""Hey, I really think it is time for me to be evil, because I love being evil."" I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations. 

Thanks

For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's ""regular"" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together.
